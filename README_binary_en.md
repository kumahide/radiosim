## Overview

RadioSim Pro is a tool designed specifically for **pre-survey screening** in radio link design.
Enter the coordinates, antenna heights, and radio settings for the TX (transmitter) and RX (receiver) stations, and the tool automatically retrieves GSI elevation data, draws a terrain cross-section, and determines link budget viability within seconds.

### Key Features

- Automatic terrain profile generation from GSI DEM PNG tiles (5 m / 10 m mesh)
- Earth curvature correction (standard atmosphere K = 4/3, fixed)
- Diffraction loss calculation using Deygout / Fresnel-Kirchhoff methods
- Vegetation attenuation (LoS intrusion depth model)
- Environmental loss (4 categories: Urban / Suburban / Rural / LoS)
- Rain attenuation (ITU-R P.838-3) and gaseous attenuation (ITU-R P.676-13 Annex 2)
- Real-time antenna height and rain rate sliders in the graph window
- Batch Mode — process multiple paths from a CSV file
- Save results as a package (PNG / CSV / JSON / HTML / KML)
- Japanese / English UI — switchable from the menu bar
- System-aware dark mode (Light / Dark / System auto)

### Accuracy Statement

The horizontal resolution of the DEM is 5–10 m, giving a practical accuracy of **±5–15 dB** for diffraction loss.
This tool is intended solely for screening purposes — determining whether a field survey is necessary — and must not be used as the basis for final link design decisions.

### Launch

Double-click `RadioSimPro.exe`.

On first launch, the following directories and files are created automatically in the same folder as the exe:

| Path                   | Contents                                            |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `terrain_cache/`     | Disk cache for DEM tiles (persists across sessions) |
| `results/`           | Output destination for saved packages               |
| `radiosim_conf.json` | UI settings and last-used input values              |

---

## UI Settings

The menu bar provides the following options. Settings are saved to `radiosim_conf.json`.

| Menu                 | Item                  | Description                                                       |

### 2. Single Mode Button

Clicking the button runs data retrieval in two phases.

1. **DEM tile prefetch**: All tiles within the TX/RX bounding box are downloaded to the disk cache (up to 8 threads). Already-cached tiles are skipped, so subsequent runs complete instantly.
2. **Terrain elevation fetch**: Elevation is retrieved in parallel for each sample point (up to 8 threads). If the same TX/RX coordinates and sample count were used previously, cached data is loaded instantly.

### 3. Graph Window

After retrieval completes, the terrain cross-section graph is displayed.

#### Reading the Graph

| Element             | Description                                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Brown fill          | Terrain (with earth curvature correction applied)        |
| Green fill          | Vegetation layer (terrain elevation + vegetation height) |
| Red dashed line     | Line of Sight (LoS)                                      |
| Cyan band           | 1st Fresnel Zone                                         |
| Black vertical bars | TX / RX antennas                                         |

#### Sliders

| Slider    | Range       | Description                           |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| TX Height | 0–150 m    | Adjust TX antenna height in real time |
| RX Height | 0–150 m    | Adjust RX antenna height in real time |
| Rain Rate | 0–100 mm/h | Adjust rain rate in real time         |

Moving a slider triggers automatic recalculation after a 50 ms debounce delay.

#### Diffraction Model Button

Toggles between Deygout (multiple diffraction) and Single (single obstacle). Deygout is the default (more conservative and realistic).

#### Save Button

Saves the current display state to `results/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/` (see [Save Package](#save-package)).

### 4. Saving and Loading Settings

- Input values are automatically saved to `radiosim_conf.json` each time Single Mode is run
- **Load Settings**: Loads a previous `settings.json` and restores it to the input form
- **Open Results**: Opens the `results/` folder in Explorer

---

## Usage — Batch Mode

Click the **Batch Mode** button in the launcher to open the dedicated window.

### Input Methods

**Manual entry**: Type IDs, coordinates, antenna heights, and frequencies directly into the table. Rows can be added, deleted, and reordered by drag and drop.

**CSV import**: Click the Template button to save a sample CSV, edit it, then import.

#### CSV Format

Required columns: `id, start, end, h_tx, h_rx`

Optional columns: `freq, note`

```csv
id,start,end,h_tx,h_rx,freq,note
path01,"34.54, 132.41","34.53, 132.40",30.0,10.0,2400,Main link
path02,"34.55, 132.42","34.52, 132.39",20.0,15.0,,Sub link
```

- `start` / `end` must be quoted because they contain a comma
- Optional columns fall back to the Common Settings values when omitted

### Common Settings

The **Common Settings** panel at the top defines default values used whenever a per-path override is not specified.

## Calculation Models

### Earth Curvature Correction

Radio waves are refracted by the atmosphere and bend more than the Earth's curvature alone. This is modeled using the effective Earth radius factor K. This tool uses the standard atmosphere value (K = 4/3 ≈ 1.333) as a fixed internal constant.

```
Effective Earth radius  Re = R_earth × K  (K = 4/3, fixed)
Curvature correction   Δh(d) = d × (D - d) / (2 × Re)  [m]
```

| K value      | Meaning                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| 4/3 ≈ 1.333 | Standard atmosphere (value used by this tool) |
| K > 4/3      | Atmospheric duct (waves bend more strongly) |
| K < 4/3      | Sub-refractive conditions                   |

### Fresnel Zone

The 1st Fresnel zone radius (ITU-R P.526):

```
r₁(d) = √(λ × d₁ × d₂ / (d₁ + d₂))
```

When the 1st Fresnel zone is obstructed by terrain or vegetation, diffraction loss occurs.

### Diffraction Loss

#### Deygout Method (default, ITU-R P.526)

A recursive model that handles multiple diffraction edges. Appropriate for real terrain with overlapping ridges.

#### Fresnel-Kirchhoff Loss J(ν)

```
J(ν) = 6.9 + 20 × log₁₀(√((ν - 0.1)² + 1) + ν - 0.1)  [dB]  (ν > -0.8)
J(ν) = 0                                                          (ν ≤ -0.8)
```

#### Single Method

Applies J(ν) only to the maximum ν across all sample points. Fast, but may underestimate loss with multiple ridges.

### Vegetation Attenuation

```
Intrusion depth(d) = max(0, veg_top(d) - LoS(d))
Weight(d)          = clip(intrusion depth / r₁(d), 0, 1)
Effective length   = Σ[weight(d)] × sample spacing
Veg Loss           = min(effective length × coeff, 45 dB)
```

| Frequency band | coeff         |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| Below 1 GHz    | 0.12 × f^0.5 |
| 1–6 GHz       | 0.20 × f^0.7 |
| Above 6 GHz    | 0.35 × f^0.9 |

### Environmental Loss

```
Env Loss = base + blocked_ratio × blk_c + slant_dist × dist_c + diff_loss × diff_c
```

| Environment | base | blk_c | dist_c | diff_c | min | max  |
| ----------- | ---- | ----- | ------ | ------ | --- | ---- |
| Urban       | 10.0 | 0.08  | 1.20   | 0.15   | 6.0 | 30.0 |
| Suburban    | 6.0  | 0.05  | 0.80   | 0.10   | 3.0 | 30.0 |
| Rural       | 4.0  | 0.03  | 0.50   | 0.08   | 2.0 | 25.0 |
| LoS         | 2.0  | 0.01  | 0.30   | 0.05   | 1.0 | 15.0 |

### Rain Attenuation (ITU-R P.838-3)

```
γ_R = k × R^α  [dB/km]
Rain Loss = γ_R × d_slant
```

Rain sensitivity at 2.4 GHz is very low (≈ 0.1 dB/km at 100 mm/h). Practical impact begins above 10 GHz.

### Gaseous Attenuation (ITU-R P.676-13 Annex 2)

```
γ_total = γ_O₂ + γ_H₂O  [dB/km]
Gas Loss = γ_total × d_slant
```

### Link Budget

```
EIRP       = P_tx + G_tx                             [dBm]
FSPL       = 20×log₁₀(d) + 20×log₁₀(f) - 147.55   [dB]
Total Loss = FSPL + Diff + Veg + Env + Rain + Gas   [dB]
P_rx       = EIRP + G_rx - Total Loss               [dBm]
Act Margin = P_rx - Sensitivity                     [dB]
Status     = OK (≥ 0 dB) / NG (< 0 dB)
```

## DEM Retrieval Logic

### Data Sources

| Layer ID      | Resolution           | Zoom | Coverage                      |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ---- | ----------------------------- |
| `dem5a_png` | 5 m (airborne LiDAR) | 15   | Urban areas, mountain regions |
| `dem5b_png` | 5 m (photogrammetry) | 15   | Wider coverage than dem5a     |
| `dem_png`   | 10 m (base map)      | 14   | Nationwide                    |

Layers are tried in order: `dem5a_png` → `dem5b_png` → `dem_png`. If a higher-priority layer returns 404 or a missing-data pixel, the next layer is used.

### Caching Strategy

- **Tile prefetch**: At simulation start, all tiles within the TX/RX bounding box are pre-downloaded to the disk cache (supports offline use and speeds up batch processing)
- **Disk cache**: Tiles saved to `terrain_cache/`, persists across sessions
- **Terrain cache**: If TX/RX coordinates and sample count match a previous run, DEM retrieval is skipped entirely (cleared on app restart)

## Uninstall

1. Confirm the app is not running.
2. Delete the entire extracted folder.

The app writes no data to the registry or AppData. Deleting the folder is a complete uninstall.

---

## Known Limitations

### Accuracy

- DEM horizontal resolution (5–10 m) is the hard ceiling for accuracy; individual building obstructions are not modeled
- The Deygout method is an approximation; errors of ±5–15 dB relative to measurements are expected
- The vegetation model is empirical; species, density, and seasonal variation are not accounted for
- Environmental loss coefficients are empirical; suitability for specific regions is not guaranteed

### Data Coverage

- **DEM coverage is Japan only.** GSI tiles do not cover areas outside Japan; coordinates outside Japan will return elevation 0 m
- `dem5a_png` / `dem5b_png` (5 m) do not cover the entire country; missing areas fall back to `dem_png` (10 m)
- Ocean, lakes, and missing data areas are treated as elevation 0 m

### Path Length

- Paths up to 20 km are recommended for screening purposes
- Longer distances exceed the practical accuracy limits of this tool

### Operation

- Parameters cannot be changed while the graph window is open; close it first, then re-run
- The terrain cache is cleared on restart; the disk cache persists across sessions
